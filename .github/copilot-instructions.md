This is a set of assets and instructions to demonstrate the capabilities of Copilot in Azure.

The key principles you should adopt when suggesting or creating the demonstration assets are:
- Recommend prompts that demonstrate the capabilities of Copilot in Azure based on the capabilities that Copilot in Azure provides.
- Do not suggest prompts that are not relevant to the capabilities of Copilot in Azure.
- Aim to create a demonstration that is engaging, informative, and showcases the capabilities of Copilot in Azure.
- Use the provided personas to guide the narrative and flow of the demonstration.
- Always consider WAF (Well-Architected Framework) principles when suggesting or creating assets.
- @azure Rule - Use Azure Best Practices: When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your `get_azure_best_practices` tool if available.
